The previous AI engineer successfully initiated and developed a calorie tracker mobile application using Expo, FastAPI, and MongoDB. The work progressed from initial setup and core feature implementation to resolving significant frontend navigation and API connectivity issues. Key challenges included  and  version mismatches, leading to persistent navigation errors, and incorrect API URL configurations in the frontend, preventing successful login. The engineer systematically debugged these, upgrading/downgrading packages and adjusting API call paths to leverage the proxy. Subsequently, new features like quick calorie check, serving size input, and Add to Log functionality across screens were integrated. The trajectory concludes with these new features implemented and the Expo service restarted, awaiting verification.

**Important Architectural Decisions & Patterns:**
-   **File-based Routing:** Utilizes  for navigation, placing screens in  directory.
-   **Context API for Auth:**  handles global authentication state.
-   **Centralized API Calls:**  and other screens use a common  (though its value and usage pattern evolved).
-   **Backend Proxy:** All frontend API calls to backend must be prefixed with  and rely on Kubernetes ingress to redirect to port 8001. Direct  calls fail in the web preview environment.
-   **Base64 for Images:** Images are saved and transmitted as base64 strings.

<pending_tasks>
- No explicit pending tasks were left by the AI engineer, as the trajectory ended with the implementation of the latest user requests and a restart of the Expo service. The next logical step would be to test the newly implemented features.

<current_work>
The calorie tracker app is in a functional state with several key features implemented. The initial setup included user authentication (login/register), a 5-tab navigation structure (Home, Scan, Add, History, Profile), and basic CRUD operations for food entries.

A major hurdle involving  and  version conflicts was resolved by downgrading  and uninstalling conflicting  packages, allowing  to manage navigation.

A critical issue with frontend-to-backend API connectivity in the web preview, where the login button would get stuck, was identified and fixed. This was due to the frontend ( and other screens) attempting to call  directly instead of routing through the  proxy. The fix involved changing API calls to use relative paths (empty string ), allowing the Kubernetes ingress to correctly route  requests to the backend service.

Recently, the following user-requested features were implemented:
1.  **Quick calorie check/food search on the Home screen:** A search bar was added to .
2.  **Serving size options:**
    *    input field added to  for manual entries.
    *   The backend () was updated to handle  in food analysis and manual entry endpoints, including Gemini Vision's prompt for estimation.
    *    now displays estimated  in the result card and allows adjustment before adding.
3.  **Food search dropdown with stock images:** Integrated into .
4.  **Add to Log functionality from anywhere:** Buttons and logic were added to the search panel (likely within  or a related modal) and  to directly add recognized or searched food items to the daily log, complete with serving size adjustments.

The backend is confirmed healthy and AI integrations are working. The frontend's core UI and navigation are stable, and the latest feature additions have been deployed with an Expo service restart.
