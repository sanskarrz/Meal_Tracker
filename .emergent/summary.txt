The previous AI engineer successfully launched the Healthism Plus calorie tracker. Initial work addressed  and API connectivity, implementing core features like AI food recognition (Google Gemini Vision), manual entry, daily tracking, history, profile, and JWT authentication. Significant UX improvements included custom modals for alerts, loading skeletons, and error handling, making the app production-ready.

The trajectory then details extensive debugging and feature enhancements. Key issues included fixing backend login (bcrypt/passlib conflicts, password field mismatch), restarting services, and addressing multiple frontend UI/UX problems such as invisible navigation icons, calorie recalculation on edit, and the scan food icon on Android. The AI engineer also tackled the critical switch from Gemini to OpenAI Vision (GPT-4o, then GPT-5, then back to GPT-4o), requiring significant prompt engineering and debugging image encoding issues ( prefixes) with . Numerous UI refinements were made to meal editing, serving size quantification, and adding confirmation modals, focusing on user-friendliness, especially for elderly users. The trajectory concludes with persistent camera scanning issues due to  handling of base64 images, leading to a decision to switch to direct OpenAI SDK calls.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was grappling with persistent issues related to the camera scanning feature. Despite multiple attempts to diagnose and fix the problem, including adjusting the OpenAI model (from GPT-4o to GPT-5 and back), and repeatedly modifying the base64 image encoding (adding and then removing the  prefix) in  based on 's advice, the camera scanner remained non-functional, consistently prompting the user to scan again.

The 's latest finding indicated that  (the custom internal library for LLM integration) expects raw base64 without the data URI prefix, which was the opposite of an earlier fix. The AI engineer reverted this change in .

The current state is that the camera scan is still reported as not working by the user. Consequently, the AI engineer has decided to abandon  for OpenAI API calls and switch to using the official OpenAI SDK directly to resolve the image upload and analysis failures. This is a critical pivot in the technical approach for AI integration.
