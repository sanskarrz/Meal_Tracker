-      message: "CRITICAL FRONTEND AUTHENTICATION ISSUE: Cannot test Quick Search features due to authentication system preventing access to home screen. Backend authentication endpoints are working correctly (successfully tested /api/auth/register and /api/auth/login). Frontend authentication flow appears broken - app remains on login screen even after successful authentication attempts. This blocks all home screen feature testing including camera button navigation and dropdown search functionality. Requires immediate investigation of AuthContext.tsx and authentication flow in frontend."

+      message: "AUTHENTICATION FIX IMPLEMENTED: Fixed the critical frontend authentication issue by implementing cross-platform storage wrapper in AuthContext.tsx. The problem was AsyncStorage not working in web environment. Solution uses localStorage for web and AsyncStorage for mobile platforms. This resolves the login screen persistence issue and should allow proper authentication flow completion. All frontend features (Quick Search, Food Search API Integration) are now ready for re-testing after authentication fix."
